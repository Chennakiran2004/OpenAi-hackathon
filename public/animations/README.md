# Listening animation for Voice Agent

Add a DotLottie file here so the mic "listening" state shows an animation.

1. Go to [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/free-animations/listening) or search for "microphone" / "listening".
2. Pick an animation and download it as **DotLottie** (`.lottie`).
3. Save the file as **`listening.lottie`** in this folder (`public/animations/`).

The Voice Agent will show this animation when the user clicks the mic and the app is listening.
